TypeScript Cache Corruption Fix Applied

Issue: TypeScript showing phantom file with newlines in name
File: leaveManagement\n\nController.ts (corrupted cache entry)
Actual: leaveManagementController.ts (correct)

✅ Cleared TypeScript cache
✅ Removed .tsbuildinfo files
✅ File verified as valid UTF-8

Next Steps:
1. In VSCode: Cmd+Shift+P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
2. Or: Reload Window (Cmd+Shift+P → "Reload Window")
3. Error should disappear

The file exists and is valid. This is purely a TypeScript cache issue.
