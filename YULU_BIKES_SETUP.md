---

## 📂 **Step 1: Create the Folder**

Create this folder in your project:
```
client/public/yulu-bikes/
```

Full path:
```
/Users/sagarkm/Downloads/WorkforceManagement/client/public/yulu-bikes/
```

---

## 🖼️ **Step 2: Add Your Images**

Save the 4 Yulu bike images you shared with these exact names:

1. **`yulu-white.png`** - White/Grey Yulu bike
2. **`yulu-red.png`** - Red Yulu bike  
3. **`yulu-silver.png`** - Silver Yulu bike
4. **`yulu-cyan.png`** - Cyan/Blue Yulu bike

Place them in:
```
client/public/yulu-bikes/
```

## 📐 **Image Sizes in Background**

The bikes will display at these sizes:

- **White bike** (top left): 192px × 192px (w-48)

## ✨ **Features**

✅ **Fitting sizes** - Bikes are sized appropriately for the background  
✅ **15% opacity** - Subtle, not distracting  
✅ **Floating animation** - Smooth up/down movement  
✅ **Drop shadow** - Gives depth  
✅ **Error handling** - If image doesn't load, it won't show broken image

## 📍 **Positions**

- **Top Left**: White/Grey Yulu bike
- **Top Right**: Red Yulu bike
- **Bottom Left**: Silver Yulu bike
- **Bottom Right**: Cyan Yulu bike

---

## 🚀 **Quick Setup Commands**

```bash
# Create the folder
mkdir -p client/public/yulu-bikes

# Then copy your 4 bike images into that folder with these names:
# - yulu-white.png
# - yulu-red.png
# - yulu-silver.png
# - yulu-cyan.png
```

---

## ⚠️ **Important**

- Use **.png** files with transparent backgrounds for best results
- File names must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)
- Images should be reasonably sized (500-1000px works well)
- If an image is missing, it simply won't display (no error)

---

## ✅ **After Setup**

Once you add the images:
1. Refresh the browser
2. You'll see the 4 Yulu bikes floating in the background
3. They'll gently animate up and down
4. At 15% opacity, they're visible but subtle
